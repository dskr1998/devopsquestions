126.cidr stands for ?
  ans:- class less inter domain routing 
127.why cidr is introduced ?
  ans:-In classfull ip addressing the network bits and host bits are distributed over fixed octets, due to which we will not have        flexibility of creating network of computers with varied size.To overcome the above problem, CIDR has been introduced. So CIDR         allows us to assign flexibily the network and host bits in an ip address,so there is no ip classification.
128.in cidr how to compute network address and host address ?
  ans:-#1. represent the ip address in binary format
       #2. represent the subnet mask in binary format by turning on the network bits specified in the ip notation and remaining bits 	           as off
       #3. do an BIT AND operation on these bits
       #4. convert the result into decimal notation based on place value of the BIT
       #5 This will provide network address and starting ip of the network
