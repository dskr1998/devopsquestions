=====================================================================================================================================
foreground process  vs background process
-----------------------------------------
94.what is foreground process ?
  ans:- The foreground process are the processes that requires user interaction during the execution and may take user input while              executing  the program.these are always attached to the TTY (terminal) and blocks until the program completes the execution.
95.by default when we run a program in linux operating system by default the program executes in which process ?
  ans:- foreground only
96.what is background process ?
  ans:- These are the processes that doesnt requires user interaction or doesnt take any input from the user and executes the                 instructions of  the program and generates the output and terminates
97.if these processes/programs are executed as foreground, even though they dont need user input still they block terminal and runs
   unnecessarily 2 process.what are those ?
  ans:- (i).program process
	(ii).terminal process
98.How to run a program as background process in linux?
  ans:- ./run.sh &     (here & indicates run the program in background)
99.how to redirect the output of a background process ?
  ans:- we can redirect the output of the program to an file using nohup command
	ex:- nohup ./run.sh &

  ans:- ls -l
121.what is reason behind creating an user by default with the group as username group only ?
  ans:- user will be created with a  default group as username group.so that only user would exists in his group by which by default           any file/dir we create on the machine has access by the owner by himself as he is the only one who exists in that group.
122.How many levels at which we assign permissions to a file/folder in Linux?
  ans:- 3 levels 
	(i).user level
	(ii).group level
	(iii).others
123.how many types of permissions we can assign to a file/folder ?
  ans:- rwx
124.when we list the files/folder using ls -l what is the first letter contains ?

128.chmod supports how many modes of changing the file permissions ?
  ans:- 2 modes	
	(i).octal mode
	(ii).symbolic mode
129.in octal mode what is the number assigned to each permission ?
  ans:- read : 4 
	write : 2
	execute : 1
130.in symbolic notation what are the symbols assigned to a each permission ?
  ans:- read : r
	write : w
	execute : x
131.the permissions assigned to 3 types of people which are also indicates symbols ?
  ans:- u = user (or) owner
	g = group
	o = others
132.in symbolic notation how we can change the permissions ?
  ans:- we need to use operators.
        + = add
	- = remove
	= = reset permissions
133.what is the difference b/w +,- and = ?
  ans:- +,- will add or remove the existing permissions,but = will reset the existing permissions.
134.how does linux derives default permission for a file/folder while creating ?
  ans:- using umask
135.what is umask ?
  ans:- which is used for computing the default permissions while create a file/folder.
136.what is the default umask value for the root user ?
  ans:- 0002
137.what is the default umask value for normal user ?
  ans:- 0022
138.what are the dafault max permissions allowed to a file ?
  ans:- 666
139.what are the default max permissions allowed to a directory ?
  ans:- 777
140.how to compute the default permissions to a file ?
  ans:- default max permissions : 666
	umask : 0002
	666
	022
	---
	644     similarly dir also 777 and substract umask.
141.how to change the umask value permanently ?
  ans:- vi ~/.bashrc   here add
	umask 0022

*****************
142.why root user and normal user have different umask values ?
  ans:-
always a root/super user will be created in his username/own group only, since he is the only user who exists in his group, there is
 no point in allocating a different permission for the group so the umask value for the user/group will be same which is = 002

whereas a normal user can be created other than the usergroup by using -g option in such case we want to differentiate file/folder
 permissions from owner to group so the default umask = 022
======================================================================================================================================

sudoers
-------
175.what is sudoers ?
  ans:- The few normal users of the linux operating system can be promoted as sudoers, so that they can act as Root and can perform 	        operations  onbehalf of the Root user on the linux operating system.
176.what is diff b/w root and sudoers ?
  ans:- a sudoer can act as an Root, but Root user can enfore restrictions on sudoer allowing him to perform certain operations only
177.how many ways we can promote  normal user as a sudoer ?
 ans:- two ways 
	(i).add an entry into /etc/sudoers file
	(ii).create file with name called username and add
178.what is the syntax of promoting normal user as a sudoers ?
  ans:- username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
	1 st ALL = any location ,
	2 nd ALL = any user
	3 rd ALL = any group
	4 th ALL = any command
179.how many sections are there in sudoers file for making user as a sudoer ?
  ans:- 2 sections (i).user section
		   (ii). group section
180.how to add group into the sudoers ?
  ans:- %groupname ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
181.in sudoers file how to differentiate the user and group ?
  ans:- group contains % (% indicates group)
182.While modifying the sudoers file if in case if we have written sudoers entry wrongly/syntactical mistake what will happen ?
  ans:- all the users of the linux operating system will looose sudoers access
183.how can we validate the changes we made in sudoers file before apply?
  ans:- 
	1. copy the contents of the sudoers file into /tmp directory
	cp /etc/sudoers /tmp
	2. make the changes into the /tmp/sudoers file
	3. validate the changes we made are correct or wrong in /tmp/sudoers using
	visudo -cf /tmp/sudoers
	parsed ok
	4. copy the tmp file replacing the original file under /etc/sudoers

	-c = check
	-f = file to be checked
184.in case if we modify the sudoers file with a syntax mistake then everyone will loose sudoers access then how to fix the sudoers 	error?
  ans:-use pkexec command
	pkexec visudo /etc/sudoers
185.sudo = executing a command onbehalf root only
    pkexec = executing any linux command onbehalf any user (even you are not sudoer)
186.How to enforce restrictions on the sudoers in granting permissions?
  ans:-
	To enforce restrictions on sudoers to execute the commands on a 
        1. From specific host
        2. specific user/group
	3. commands
187.for enforcing restrictions what we need to declare in sudoers file ? how many types are there ?
  ans:- we need to declare alias.there are four types of aliases are there
	(i).user alias
	(ii).Runas_alias
	(iii).Host_alias
	(iv).Cmnd_alias
188.what is Cmnd_alias ? how to declare it ?
  ans:- command alias are used for defining list of commands that are allowed for sudoer to execute onbehalf of root user.
	Cmnd_Alias FILE_MGMT_CMD=/usr/bin/ls,/usr/bin/touch,/usr/sbin/useradd
	username ALL=(ALL:ALL) FILE_MGMT_CMD
189.who can execute the pkexec command ?

190.what is host alias ? how to declare it in sudoers file ?
  ans:- we can grant the permissions to the sudoer to connect through specific hostname of the computer for executing commands.
	Host_Alias REMOTE_HOST=192.168.10.5
	username REMOTE_HOST=(ALL:ALL) ALL
191.what is user alias ? how to declare it ?
  ans:- we can specify a set of users to grab sudo/root access to perform operations 
  	User_Alias DEVOPS_GROUP=joe,bob,stephen
