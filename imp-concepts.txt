EXPECT
------
1.when we are automating the installation process then some software packages requires to run the scritp file during the installation   process,so how to pass the input values ?

3.example of passing values using expect 

	addnum.sh
	#!/bin/bash
	read -p "enter number a : " a
	read -p "enter number b : " b
	sum : $[a+b]
	
	expectaddnum.sh
	#!/usr/bin/expect -f
	timeout -1
	spawn ./addnum.sh
	expect "enter number a : " 
	send -- "10\r"
	expect "enter number b : "
	send -- "20\r"
	eof
	
here -f specifies a file to read from
4.we can pass variables also

expectaddnum.sh
	#!/usr/bin/expect -f
	timeout -1
	set A "10"
	set B "20"
	spawn ./addnum.sh
	expect "enter number a : " 
	send -- "$A\r"
	expect "enter number b : "
	send -- "$B\r"
	eof
