	(ii).can be used for transferring the files/folders between cloud to on-premise
	(iii).used for data migration
	(iv).we can store the data on efs location so that it can be shared across multiple ec2 instances for data analytics and data 	     processing
9.what are the differences b/w standard and one-zone ?
  ans:- standard :- it will provision across all the subnets of the vpc.
		    low network latency.
		    high availability.
		    higher throughput or scaled performance.
		    The cost of storage is very high.

12.what is access point ?
  ans:- an access point is an pointer to the efs storage.
13.how to work with mount targets ?
  ans:-we can access the efs location by mounting the mounttarget onto the ec2 instances with in the vpc,through mount targets
	
14.through mount target which directory we can access and perform the operations on behalf of which user ?
  ans:- we can access the root file system of the EFS.
	all the operations we perform on the efs location will be performed on the root user.
15.how to work with access points ?
  ans:- For each application we create an separate access point dedicating a directory. 
	per each application create a user and configure in access point to perform operations on efs location through the application
	user.
16.what are the adwantages of using access points ?
  ans:-(i)every application will perform operations on their dedicated directory location on the efs location, so no chance of 2 		  different applications overlapping the data of each other
       (ii).security, not 2 different applications can see or access others data
       (iii).multiple instances of the application can access the accesspoint through the same user
17.main difference b/w mount target and access points ?
  ans:- througu mount target we can access "/" (root)
	through access points we can access the directory inside the root.(with specific user)
