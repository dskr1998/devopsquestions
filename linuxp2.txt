114.what is the difference b/w pipe and exec/ok when we are using them along with find ?
  ans:- when we are using pipe
	all the matching files/folders will be passed as an input to the shell command at one shot, if the shell command accepts 	 	multi-line input it works otherwise it will fail
	when using exec/ok
	it passes each matching file/directory as input and execute the shell command line by line
 	
	ex:- find dir/ -name "pattern" | wc -l
	     find dir/ -type d -name "pattern" -exec ls {} \;
	     find dir/ -type f -name "pattern" -exec cat {} \;
****
if we are using a shell command that works on multi-line input use pipe (|) operator
if you command works per line or a single-line input then use -exec or -ok
